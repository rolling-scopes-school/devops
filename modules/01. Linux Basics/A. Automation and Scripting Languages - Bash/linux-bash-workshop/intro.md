# Hello.

You are going to some basics to work with bash scripts on a Linux system

There are a few hints how to be successful, learning it:

1. First of all - save your solutions, because you have only one hour to complete it. When time is up, you will start from the very beginning, so to be able to skip solved tasks, just copy your saved commands.
2. Don't be impatient. If you tried, and you failed too many times - get some rest, don't panic and have no doubts. Eventually, you will finish it. Everyone is different. For some of us it
   needs less time than for the others. I believe you can do it.
3. Don't ignore BASH documentation, use in-built command manuals and helps, be creative and explore each command in details. Be attentive and you will be rewarded.
4. There is no goal for a true samurai, there is only a path.
