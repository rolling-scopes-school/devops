# Task description:

1. Create /scripts/address.sh. It should take an argument and print a message if it is:  
    1.1 IPv4 address -> prints "IPv4"  
    1.2 IPv6 address -> prints "IPv6"  
    1.3 MAC address -> prints "MAC"  
    1.4 If it doesn't match, prints "Unknown"  
2. Modify /scripts/numbers.sh:  
    2.1 It should take a number A (more than 0 and below 100)
    2.2 It should print number by words, f.e. `numbers.sh 15` should print 'fifteen' whereas `numbers.sh 67` should print 'sixty seven'
