## Adding evidence of completing task to repository
First of all we need to create branch for current task.
Click at the current branch name `main` (1), input new branch name (2), e.g. `linux` and click "Create branch: linux".  
![Step 9](./gh-cross-check-guide-imgs/step-09.png)  
After that you will be at `linux` branch and ready to upload files.

Create folder at you computer and name it as the task, e.g. `linux`. Place screenshots or another needed files to this folder. Select folder in your Explorer and just drag-n-drop it to the GitHub page of your repository with selected branch of the task.  
Provide commit message after files are uploaded and click "Commit changes".

Now we should create a Pull Request to a main branch and a link of this Pull Request should be submitted to RSS App.  
So we have a message in our repository that `linux` branch has changes and there is a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it.  
Provide Pull Request title as task name, e.g. `linux` and click "Create pull request".  
Copy a link in address bar and submit it at "Cross-check: Submit" page of RSS App

Now students could check you files during cross-check at Pull Request page in "Files" tab.
