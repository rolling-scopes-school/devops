### What Is Virtualization?
Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create virtual instances of computer hardware or software within a single physical system. It enables the emulation of multiple virtual environments, such as virtual machines (VMs), operating systems, storage devices, or network resources, on a single physical server or host. These virtual instances, often called "virtualization instances" or "virtualized environments", operate independently and can run different operating systems and applications.

Virtualization offers several benefits, including efficient resource utilization, hardware consolidation, easier management, scalability, and improved disaster recovery options. It has become a fundamental technology in modern IT infrastructure, enabling the efficient allocation and sharing of computing resources in data centers and cloud environments. Popular virtualization platforms include VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, and VirtualBox.

### What Is a Hypervisor?
The software that enables the creation and management of virtual computing environments is called a hypervisor. It’s a lightweight software or firmware layer that sits between the physical hardware and the virtualized environments and allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine. The hypervisor abstracts and partitions the underlying hardware resources, such as central processing units (CPUs), memory, storage, and networking, and allocates them to the virtual environments.  You can think of the hypervisor as the middleman that pulls resources from the raw materials of your infrastructure and directs them to the various computing instances.

There are two types of hypervisors: 

- Type 1, bare-metal hypervisors, run directly on the hardware. 
- Type 2 hypervisors operate within a host operating system. 

Hypervisors are fundamental to virtualization technology, enabling efficient utilization and management of computing resources.

### Binaries
In general, binaries are non-text files made up of ones and zeros that tell a processor how to execute a program.

### Libraries
Libraries are sets of prewritten code that a program can use to do either common or specialized things. They allow developers to avoid rewriting the same code over and over.

### Kernels
Kernels are the ringleaders of the OS. They’re the core programming at the center that controls all other parts of the operating system.
