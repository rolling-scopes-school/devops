### Use Cases for VMs vs. Use Cases for Containers
Both containers and virtual machines (VMs) offer distinct advantages and drawbacks, and your choice should align with your specific requirements.

When it comes to selecting the appropriate technology for your workloads, VMs excel in scenarios where applications necessitate full access to the operating system's resources and functionality. VMs are ideal for situations where you need to run multiple applications on servers or manage a diverse array of operating systems. If you have an existing monolithic application that doesn't require refactoring into microservices, VMs will continue to fulfill your needs effectively.

On the other hand, containers prove to be a superior choice when your primary objective is to maximize the number of applications or services running on a minimal number of servers while prioritizing portability. If you're embarking on the development of a new application and intend to employ a microservices architecture for scalability and portability, containers are the preferred solution. Containers truly shine in the realm of cloud-native application development, particularly within a microservices architecture.

It's worth noting that you can also run containers within a virtual machine, making the decision less of an "either/or" and more of an evaluation to determine which technology aligns best with your workload requirements.

In summary:

- VMs enable companies to optimize their infrastructure resources by increasing the number of virtual machines achievable from a finite pool of hardware and software resources.
- Containers empower companies to maximize their development resources, facilitating the adoption of microservices and DevOps practices.
