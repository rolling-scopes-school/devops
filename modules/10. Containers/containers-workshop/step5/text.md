## Part 5: Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

Based on the content that you can [find in the repo](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/devops/modules/10. Containers/Part5), follow the following steps to configure the application using configmaps:

**Fill configmap.yaml to add a configmap with a environment variable CUSTOM_MESSAGE with today's date. Then using kubectl create the configmap and the pod and ensure it's running. Then create a custom loadbalancer taking as example service.yaml to expose kubernetes port 8000 through machine port 4000.**

> To run your configuration use pod-configmap.yaml and the steps you learned in previous steps.
