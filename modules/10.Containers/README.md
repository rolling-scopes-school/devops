## How to do the task?

### 1. Sign into Killercoda

You could use your Github account

### 2. Take the entire workshop - [Workshop Link](https://killercoda.com/rsschool/course/modules/containers-workshop)

Once you finish it, do not close the environment!

### 3. Execute an `echo` command with your github name in the KillerCoda environment console

For example `$echo rsschool-repository`

### 4. Validate your participation!

Take a screenshot of the completion screen `Thanks for participating in this Workshop!` and your github name in the KillerCoda environment console. Besides, it should contain the date and time.

### 5. Cross-check

Upload a screenshot to the RS School portal. Your result will be cross-checked by another student of the course, and you will have to check someone else result.
