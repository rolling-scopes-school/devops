# CI/CD Workshop.

In this workshop, you'll not build a pipeline, but instead, you going to debug a pipeline, and check what is missing or what is wrong in the pipeline.

You'll be using the demo reviewed in the presentation and you will have to identify what is happening with the pipeline.

## Pre Requiriments

1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/ivdgonzalezco/go-demo)  where the pipeline challenge awaits.
2. Go to the Actions Tap where the pipeline is ready to be run.

So your tasks are:

1. Run the pipeline to check where is failing.
2. Solve the errors and issues and document them in a Markdown file.
2. Upload all the evidence to your github repository, detailing all the issues the pipeline has and how you solve them, in a Markdown file. Also, upload a screenshot of the pipeline working and a link to the Github Actions execution in the same file.
