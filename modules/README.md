**RS School** is a free-of-charge and community-based education program run by the Rolling Scopes developer community since 2013.
Thousands of graduated trainees in 11 countries and 500+ mentors around the world.

#### What are our principles?
- **Open to everyone.** Free courses, no obligations, and no contracts. No age limit. Only studentsâ€™ time and dedication are required. Students can repeatedly attend courses.
- **Open source philosophy.** [Our Learning Management System](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app) platform and education materials are publicly available on GitHub and YouTube.
- **Teach it forward** According to this principle, students study at school for free, but we request that they return as mentors to pass on their knowledge to the next generation of students.

## RS AWS Club
