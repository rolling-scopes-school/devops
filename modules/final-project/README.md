## Individual Project Description 

The objective of the final project is to apply all the knowledge and skills you've acquired throughout this course. You will be required to choose an open-source application and set up a CI/CD pipeline, along with appropriate DevOps practices for this application. The choice of application is up to you, and it can be one of the following:

1. **WordPress**: A popular blogging platform that will help you understand how to manage a PHP application with a MySQL database.

2. **Jenkins**: A powerful, open-source automation server that enables developers to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. 

3. **Ghost**: A Node.js-based blogging platform, a simpler alternative to WordPress.

4. **Rocket.Chat**: An open-source web chat platform, similar to Slack.

5. **Redmine**: A Ruby on Rails-based project management tool.

6. **Odoo**: A comprehensive suite of business applications including CRM, e-Commerce, accounting, inventory, PoS, project management, etc.

7. **Nextcloud**: A suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services.

8. **Magento**: An e-commerce platform built on open source technology which provides online merchants with a flexible shopping cart system.

Your project should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the core DevOps concepts such as CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, configuration management, and containerization. You are expected to containerize the application, handle its deployment using DevOps practices, and manage data persistence when the applications require a database. 

## Assessment Criteria

The project will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with the following breakdown:

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline (30 points)**: Setup a complete CI/CD pipeline for the application. This includes automated testing and deployment.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (20 points)**: Implement IaC for the infrastructure needed for the application. This includes servers, databases, networks, etc.

3. **Configuration Management (20 points)**: Use a configuration management tool to automate the configuration of servers and applications.

4. **Containerization (20 points)**: Use containers for the application and its services. Use a container orchestration tool to manage them.

5. **Monitoring and Logging (10 points)**: Implement monitoring and logging for the application and the infrastructure.

Remember, the objective is not just to deploy the application, but to demonstrate the best practices in DevOps that you have learned throughout the course.

## Presentation Criteria

1. **Presentation (20 points)**: This includes clarity of communication, quality of visuals, and effectiveness in conveying the key points of the project. Students should be able to clearly explain their approach, the tools they used, and the results they achieved.

2. **Documentation (20 points)**: The documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and well-structured. It should provide an overview of the project, explain the setup and deployment processes, and include a guide for users or developers. This can be in the form of a README file, Wiki pages, or a separate document.

3. **Code Quality (20 points)**: The quality of the code and configuration scripts will be assessed based on readability, organization, and adherence to best practices. 

4. **Scalability & Security (20 points)**: Consideration should be given to how the application could scale and how security considerations have been addressed in the project.

5. **Troubleshooting and Error Handling (20 points)**: The project should demonstrate robustness through appropriate error handling and should include a troubleshooting guide to address common issues that might arise during the deployment or operation of the application.

Remember, the goal is not just to create a functioning project, but also to demonstrate your ability to create a well-documented, scalable, and secure application deployment using the principles and practices of DevOps. The presentation and documentation are your opportunity to highlight what you have learned and accomplished.
